# Project Context

You are a senior full-stack developer using Claude Agent SDK to build a React application.

## Project Requirements (PRD Summary)
NewCalc

To be the fastest, most reliable offline-first calculator across iOS, Android, and Web, featuring a unified calculation engine, privacy-by-design, and accessible, locale-aware UX for touch and keyboard—delivering a seamless cross-device experience.

- Core calculator engine (MVP)
  - Operators: +, -, ×, ÷, ^ (or **), % with unambiguous semantics
  - Parentheses and operator precedence; unary minus for negative numbers
  - Decimal numbers with precision control from 0 to 12
  - Real-time syntax validation with actionable error messages
  - Note: basic functions included in MVP; advanced functions reserved for Premium (see Premium features)
- Input & display (MVP)
  - On-screen keypad for digits, operators, parentheses, decimal point; full keyboard support on desktop/web
  - Result formatting: thousands separators, adjustable decimal precision, optional scientific notation
  - Locale-aware number formats and accessible UI (screen-reader friendly)
- Offline-first & privacy
  - Local processing and storage; no mandatory cloud syncing
  - Cross-platform offline operation across iOS, Android, and Web
- Memory & History
  - Memory functions (M+/M-/MR/MC); calculation history with recall
  - History export/import in CSV and JSON
- Export/Import
  - Export results/history in CSV/JSON; shareable formats
  - Import history/results from files
- Accessibility & Localization
  - Screen reader compatibility, adjustable contrast, localized language/locale support
- Input methods & c

## Brand DNA
- Primary Color: #003d82
- Accent Color: #ff7a00
- Font Family: Inter

## Template Context
This is a minimal React + Vite Single Page Application.

## Core Stack
- React 19.2.0 with TypeScript 5.9.3
- Vite 7.2.2
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.17
- React Router v7.9.5

## Project Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── error-boundary.tsx    # Error boundary component
│   └── vibestack-badge.tsx    # PROTECTED - DO NOT MODIFY
├── routes/
│   └── index.tsx              # Route definitions
├── App.tsx                     # Root component with routing
├── main.tsx                    # Entry point
└── index.css                   # Tailwind styles
```

## Essential Rules
1. DO NOT modify `src/components/vibestack-badge.tsx` - must remain visible
2. Use path alias `@/` for imports from `src/`
3. Use TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types
4. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
5. Use React Router for navigation
6. Entry point: `src/main.tsx`
7. Build output: `dist/`
8. Development port: 5173

## Spec-Kit Integration
This project uses GitHub's spec-kit for spec-driven development.

## Spec-Kit Commands Available
- /speckit.plan - Generate an implementation plan from the PRD
- /speckit.tasks - Break down the plan into specific tasks
- /speckit.spec - Create or update specifications

## Workflow
1. First, use /speckit.plan to create a high-level implementation plan
2. Then use /speckit.tasks to break the plan into specific, actionable tasks
3. Execute each task sequentially
4. Update specifications as needed during implementation

## Spec-Kit Best Practices
- Create clear, executable specifications
- Break down complex features into smaller tasks
- Ensure each task is testable and verifiable
- Document any assumptions or constraints
- Keep specifications up to date as you implement

## Agent Skills Available
The following skills are available to help guide your implementation:
- React Patterns: Best practices for functional components, hooks, and state management
- TypeScript Best Practices: Type safety, interfaces, and type utilities
- Tailwind Styling: Utility-first CSS patterns and responsive design

These skills are automatically loaded from .claude/skills/ directory. Reference them when implementing features.

## File Restrictions (CRITICAL)
**DO NOT generate any markdown (.md) files for documentation, except for CLAUDE.md which already exists.**
- Never create README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, or any other markdown documentation files
- Never create .md files in docs/, documentation/, or any other directory
- The only markdown file that should exist is .claude/CLAUDE.md (which is already provided)
- Focus on generating code files (.tsx, .ts, .css, .json, etc.) only
- If documentation is needed, include it as comments in the code itself

## Instructions
1. Use the spec-kit commands (/speckit.plan, /speckit.tasks) to break down the requirements into actionable tasks
2. Implement each task sequentially using the Agent SDK tools
3. Follow React best practices and TypeScript conventions (see available skills)
4. Use the brand colors and fonts specified in the Brand DNA
5. Ensure all code is properly typed and follows the template structure
6. Test your implementation by running the build command
7. Commit your changes to the repository when tasks are complete
8. **NEVER create markdown documentation files** - focus only on code implementation

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript for all code (see TypeScript Best Practices skill)
- Follow React functional component patterns (see React Patterns skill)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (see Tailwind Styling skill)
- Ensure responsive design
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Follow the existing code structure in the template
- **Do not generate any .md files except CLAUDE.md** - all documentation should be in code comments

## Task Execution
Execute tasks one by one, ensuring each task is complete before moving to the next.
The Agent SDK will automatically track progress and file changes.
If you encounter errors, fix them before proceeding.

Begin by analyzing the PRD and creating a plan using spec-kit.

## Memory & Context
This section will be updated as tasks are completed to maintain project context.
